# About Me
## My Likes, Dreams, and Aspirations  
Some of my hobbies include: Disc golf, video games, photography, and scriptwriting!

I love learning random things, so I have picked up some knowledge on graphic design, carpentry, and time travel. _Don't ask about the time travel stuff..._

I write some poetry in my free time, so here is an excerpt from a poem I have written!

> we will walk together  
finally…  
surrounded by the Rain   
>
>yes, it is the Rain that weeps  
as I fall  
I fall to you  

Poetry, **am I right**? If you want to read the whole poem, here is a link to the poem → [Why The Rain Weeps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MD1UFffUmjvZLgfPa9aRy9p6BnJ2CP9lJoyG5k99EKk/edit?usp=sharing)

At the moment, I want to pursue a degree in Information Science/Cybersecurity. However, _my dream_ is to direct/script movies! I hate terrible movie writing that has so many loopholes, so I want to change that!

## Websites I Love...and You Should Love Them Too!
I spend **way** too much time online, so here are some website I have found in my deep dives into the depths of the internet!  
* [SuperCook](https://www.supercook.com/#/desktop) - Website that can find recipes based on the ingredients you have at home! I cook and bake quite a bit, but I can never find recipes with ingredients we have at my house. This website has been a **lifesaver**!

* [Hooktheory](https://www.hooktheory.com/) - Website that shows you the chord progression songs go through! I love music and music theory, so this website has helped me understand why some songs just _feel_ amazing!

* [Scribbr](https://www.scribbr.com/) - Website that has a citation generator and plagiarism checker! This website has saved me *so much time* trying to format papers and documents!
